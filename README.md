# Task 3 – Image Classification Model

## Objective
Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using TensorFlow.

## Dataset
CIFAR-10 dataset (10 image classes).

## Tools Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib

## Steps
1. Loaded CIFAR-10 dataset
2. Normalized image data
3. Built CNN architecture
4. Trained model
5. Evaluated performance on test data

## Result
The CNN model successfully classifies images with good accuracy.
